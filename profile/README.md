<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>Super Worms is a lighthearted racing and battle video game that replaces typical vehicles with segmented worms - giving a humorous twist to kart-style races and arena fights. It aims to provide fun multiplayer and single-player entertainment on low-spec PCs.</p>

<h2>Main Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Racing mode: race worms around tracks, collect power-ups and try to finish first.</li>
  <li>Battle mode: two-player battles where worms use items to attack opponents; each hit removes a segment of the worm.</li>
  <li>Power-ups and items: collect balloons on track that spawn weapons or special items (bombs, trampolines, speed boosts) to hinder opponents.</li>
  <li>Split-screen two-player support (on one PC), or single-player against AI.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Unique Aspects</h2>
<p>Instead of cars or karts, Super Worms uses worms composed of segments - when hit they lose segments, offering a playful and absurd twist on classic racing/battle games. The combination of racing and combat elements with worms as characters creates a distinct, humorous experience.</p>

<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>Fans of retro DOS games, players looking for quirky and casual multiplayer fun, and anyone nostalgic about 90s/early 2000s PC games. Also suitable for those who enjoy simple party games or throwback gaming sessions.</p>

  <li>Low system requirements - runs on old DOS or basic Windows setups; no need for powerful hardware.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Supported Platforms & Technical Requirements</h2>

<h2>Game Modes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Grand Prix / Racing - race through multiple tracks (laps) against AI or second player.</li>
  <li>Battle / Knock-Out / Match modes - combat arenas where worms try to knock out other worms using power-ups and items.</li>
  <li>Practice mode - run tracks solo to set time records without combat or competition.</li>
</ul>
